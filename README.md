## 🌟 Why Book Buddy?

In society, many individuals have books that are no longer of use to them, while others struggle to access those same books due to financial constraints. **Book Buddy** bridges this gap by creating a common platform where users can:

- Upload unused books to give away for free.
- Request and book these books to benefit from them without any cost.

This platform promotes sharing, reduces waste, and provides educational resources to those in need.
